Coding and Programming 2023 for FBLA SLC

This is a project for FBLA High School SLC 2023
This allows teachers to increase student involvement within their respective schools
  It will have a log in page which will determine if the person is a student or teacher.
    The student page will allow the student to know what events he will need to go to 
    The teacher page will allow the teacher to add certain students to our database and then they are able to assign events to the student. 
    One intelligent feature is that the teacher is able to see recomendation events for their students. This allows teachers to assign events that best suit the student
