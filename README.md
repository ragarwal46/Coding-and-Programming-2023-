Coding and Programming 2023 for FBLA SLC

This is a project for FBLA High School SLC 2023 by Rishi Desai, Rohak Agarwal, and Karnav Trivedi

General Overview:
This program allows teachers to increase student involvement within their respective schools. A secure login page has been added to ensure only teachers have access to the student management system. The teacher's view will allow them to add certain students to our database and then assign events to their students. 

Code Friendliness:
We have ensured to use proper variable identifiers as well as comments in our code to make sure that any other programmers who may work on this project knows what each line does and how it contributes to the project.

Documentation:
Along with this readme file, we have utilized GitKracken which is a part of GitHub that is usedufl for tracking modifications to our code and the interweaving branches also assist with knowing which file was updated at what time.

If-Then Sequences:
Our program incorporates numerous if-then sequences that saves the user time. The world revolves around time and it is imperative that our users can finish their tasks efficiently. Along with if-then sequences, we have also utilized try-except sequences as well. These blocks of code deal with error handling and make sure that the code will not crash while a user is using the app. If the application were to crash, it would instead give a simple error message guiding the user on what to do next time.

Data Storage:
Our code is linked up with a MySQL database. The database is very secure as it uses hashing algorithms, strong passwords, and backups. We have set up the database so that it automatically backs up everyday at 9:00 PM EST to ensure that our data would still be safe even if a hacker was able to infiltrate our systems. Example data of what we store would be the student's first names, last name, age, grade, GPA, and more.

Intelligent Features:
One of our intelligent features includes a statistical reccomendation system for tutoring. Students who have above the mean GPA of the class will be allowed to tutor their peers who may be struggling and have under the mean GPA. Another intelligent features that we have added is the inclusion of tooltips for user-friendliness. These tooltips display a help message when any button on the nav bar is hovered over. Both of these features combined serve as a unique tool for teachers that helps make their lives easier.

Results:
Everytime a user triggers an event such as adding a student or assigning events to the student, the request is sent immediately to the database so that record can be added or modified. The results can be dynamically updated and seen instantly when the user launches the table from the app itself. The data will be fresh and include any changes the user made during that session.

Reports:
The app allows the user to customize their output report which includes all the necessary information about a student. The app includes checkboxes which the user can select to pick and choose whichever fields of a student they would like to view.
